Wholeheartedly - Unit 2 Poject

Wholeheartedly is a larger concept that I plan to further explore beyond this project. As of now, the idea is a subscription-based collective offering music, art, and exclusive content to subscribers.

Using Express, React, NodeJS, Mongoose, and jQuery, I have developed an early build of this site offering interactive UI and mood-focused content.
